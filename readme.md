•A fun and beginner-friendly command-line calculator built using Python.
<br>
•It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and power.
<br>
•This project was created as part of my early Python learning journey and workshop practice.
<br>
<br>
🚀 Features
<br>
•Takes user name and displays a personalized welcome message
<br>
•Supports the following operations:
<br>
  Addition (+)
  <br>
  Subtraction (-)
  <br>
  Multiplication (*)
  <br>
  Division (/)
  <br>
  Modulus / Remainder (%)
  <br>
  Power (**)
  <br>
•Accepts both symbols and words (example: "add", "multiply", "division")
<br>
•Allows the user to calculate again without restarting the program
<br>
•Includes a playful message for multiplication with 0 😄
<br>
<br>
🔁 Supported Inputs
<br>
•You can enter operations using:

⚠️ Future Improvements
<br>
•This project can be improved further by adding:
  <br>
  Input validation (handling wrong numbers) 
  Division by zero protection
<br>
  Cleaner code using functions
<br>
  Shorter operation matching using .lower()
  <br>
  Better loop system
<br>
<br>
🧾 Example Usage
<br>
ENTER YOUR NAME : Prajwal
